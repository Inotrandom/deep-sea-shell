/**
 * DSS is a high-level data-oriented operative programming language. Among others,
 * its primary purpose is for communication and control of robotic systems.
 * DSS is intended to exist as both an effective means of storing, parsing, and
 * using data, but also as a simple tool for operating systems.
 * 
 * DSS is designed not just for human users, but also for systems to universally
 * send/recieve data packets on a network.
 * 
 * Grafting to DSS is a core language feature; producing your own organized commands
 * and namespaces is important to ensure the effectiveness of the language for your
 * specific needs.
